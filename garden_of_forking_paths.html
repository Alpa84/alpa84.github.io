            The text completion model under ChatGPT is optimized for one thing.
            Generating the next word of a text (actually, the next
            <a
              href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them"
              >token</a
            >). This process is repeated over and over and you end up with a
            long response. The thing is that that is just a partial view of the
            process. Every time Chatgpt has to generate the continuation of a
            text, it generates many possible options, each one along with the
            probability of how likely is the text to continue that way.
          </p>
          <h2>Branch</h2>
          <p>
            When ChatGPT is faced with alternatives it chooses one at the
            expense of the others. So, a long text is actually a pruned version
            of an vast tree.
          </p>
          <h2>Small Tree</h2>
          <p>
            The temperature parameter (that you can set using the API) is meant
            to control what path is taken. When the temperature is set to 0, the
            most probable path is taken at every step. When you increase the
            temperature the model starts randomly venturing into less probable
            paths.
          </p>
          <p>Take the following example</p>
          <h2>Big tree</h2>
          <p>
            After some light trimming and grouping you end up with a pretty
            explorable visualization of the many possible paths the model can
            produce
          </p>
          <p>
            ChatGPT text generation has a branching nature and sometimes, seeing
            just a path doesn't represent it's full potential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Curiously, this is almost an extreme version of a fictional novel
            described by J L Borges in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths"
              >The garden of forking paths</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Stepping outside Borges superb work, here is another example, much
            sillier, but illustrative
          </p>
          <p>
            I was trying to force ChatGPT to create a surprising explanation.
            This was the prompt: 'in short, the extremely funny and counterintuitive explanation of why the cheese is in the guitar is because'
          </p>
          <p>
            Exploring the paths , I found an excellent hypothesis, hiding in the
            branches. A musician used it a s a makeshift pluck" I don't think I
            would have ever find that great example just by making using chatgpt
            take random paths and producing a single stream of text.
          </p> -->

          <!-- <p>
            The text completion model under ChatGPT is optimized for one thing.
            Given a text, generate the word that comes next (actually, the next

              >token</a
            >).
          </p>

          <p>
            This process is repeated several times to produce a longer response.
            However, this is just a limited view of the process. Every time
            ChatGPT generates the continuation of a text, it offers several
            options, each accompanied by a probability of how likely it is to
            come after the current text.
          </p>

          <p>Branching Out</p>

          <p>
            When ChatGPT is presented with alternatives, it chooses one option
            and discards the others. Hence, a long text generated by ChatGPT is
            merely a trimmed version of a much larger tree.
          </p>

          <p>Small Tree, Big Possibilities</p>

          <p>
            The temperature parameter, which can be set via the API, is meant to control
            which path is taken. When the temperature is set to 0, the model
            chooses the most probable path at each step. As you increase the
            temperature, the model starts randomly venturing into less probable paths.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, after some pruning and grouping, you get a visually
            appealing representation of the many possible paths that the model
            can generate.
          </p>

          <p>
            ChatGPT's text generation process has a branching nature, and just
            seeing one path doesn't do justice to its full potential. In a way,
            this is similar to J.L. Borges's fictional novel,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths"
              >The garden of forking paths</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stepping out of Borges's brilliant work, let's look at a more
            lighthearted example to illustrate the point. I once tried to
            challenge ChatGPT to create a surprising explanation. The prompt I
            gave was: "". Exploring the different paths, I found an excellent
            hypothesis hiding in the branches: "A musician used it as a
            makeshift pluck."
          </p>

          <p>
            I wouldn't have stumbled upon that fantastic example if I had just
            made ChatGPT take random paths and produce a single stream of text.
          </p> -->

            Given a text, generate the word that comes next (actually, the next

              >token</a

            a text, it offers several options, each accompanied by a probability
            of how likely it is to come after the current text.

            Curiously, this is almost an extreme version of the concept of a
            fictional novel described by J L Borges in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths"
              >The garden of forking paths</a
            >. In the novel, Ts'ui Pei, it's imaginary author, wanted to depict
            his interpretation of the universe: "[He] believed in an infinite
            series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of
            diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the
            strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or
            ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every
            possibility."
          </p>
          <p>
            "In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one
            being the point of departure for other bifurcations." For example,
            the description of two versions of the same chapter goes like this:
            "In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain
            pass. The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the
            soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so they won
            the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a
            palace where a banquet is in progress. The shining battle appears to
            them as a continuation of the party, and they achieve victory"
          </p>

            Unlike in the fictional novel, ChatGPT text generation branches out
            at the "word level". An interactive tool that visualizes the
            different paths a text can take could be helpful for those crafting
            a text word by word.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the novel was also described as "a maze in which
            all men would lose themselves." The analogy holds true if you want
            to visualize all the possibilities that ChatGPT can generate to
            complete a medium-sized sentence. The visualization depicted above
            was produced by discarding most paths and allowing a branch to form
            only if the two top options have a similar likelihood of continuing
            from the preceding text.
