            <h2>A poetry-based blockchain</h2>
          </a>

          <p>
            At the height of an empire, which name is long lost in the sands of
            time, the sophistication and refinements of its court were
            unparalleled. Hundred of poets devoted their lives to weaving the
            most complex verses together, and patrons spent countless resources
            sustaining them. Cronists of the time reported a poet could
            diligently work a year to produce one stanza that was considered
            correct by the time's strict canon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The metric and rhyming rules where particularly rigid and
            intrincate. One stanza did not only had to have certain rhyming
            verses within itself, but it also had to reference previous stanzas,
            sometimes as far as its 10th predecessor. That way, a single word
            change could render all subsequent verses to be considered out of
            form, and the poet would have to do painstaking modifications,
            tirelessly trying different combinations of words only to find that
            no set of words satisfied all the stylistic requirements. Most of
            the time, when some patron didn't fancy some choice or words or felt
            that the poem didn't accurately depict his own magnificence and
            required some part to be changed, every verse after the altered one
            had to be redone from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The topic of the poems where typically about the heroic deeds or the
            benevolence of the parton or his ancestors. Every powerful family in
            the empire had their own poems, and they were treasured with utmost
            care. Every addition to them was celebrated with a lavish party.
            Other influential families were invited to the gathering, where the
            whole poem, including the new stanza, was triumphantly read. Each
            house's poems often told contradicting stories about the past and
            the merits of each family in the imperial expansion wars. That was a
            huge source of conflicts between the families, and each one fiercely
            defended their version of the past, as it had a direct consequence
            on each clan's current political influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those were troublesome times for the empire. Many families were
            growing more powerful than the emperor himself, and there where
            rumors of fragmentation and internal wars. It was under such
            circumstances that the emperor devised a scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
            He publicly announced that he would only grant his blessing to the
            longest epic poem. Naturally, being from the most respected and
            ancient lineage, his family poem was the vastest. He also added a
            revolutionary rule. He would allow anyone to make a new addition to
            his family's poem. The new stanza would be read on the monthly
            courtly gathering.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, some families doubled down the effort to produce new
            verses to make their own poems the longest ones, but they quickly
            realized that smaller families were extending the royal epic poem
            and including their own deeds and heroic feats for everyone to know.
            That way, the royal poem grew faster than any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only the second most prestigious family, with the second-longest
            poem, persevered on making their own poem the most extensive. They
            only stopped the effort when they figured out that, in order to
            succeed, they would have to hire more than half of the poets in the
            empire. Eventually, they started adding their new poems to the
            imperial ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The emperor's insistence to only preserve and glorify the longest
            epic poem eventually created a unified version of the empire's
            history and helped solidify his power.
          </p>
          <h2>But wait, is this a blockchain?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes! And it has all the basic features of a proof-of-work-based
            blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system creates a "shared database" (of notable family deeds)
            where information (poems) cannot be deleted or modified, only added.
            Instead of conquests or victories, a crypto-currency blockchain
            would store information about currency transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each stanza is a block, and each block is chained to the previous
            blocks (by the strict metric and rhyming rules), forming a "block
            chain". In a crypto-currency blockchain every block is chained to
            the previous blocks using a cryptographic trick, but the effects are
            similar. Changing one bit of data of any block would render all
            subsequent blocks useless, and a lot of work would have to be made
            to re-build the rest of the chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, the poets would be the miners, working diligently to
            add a new block to the chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curiously, this system also shares a problem of proof-of-work-based
            blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. By design, it takes a lot
            of resources to add a new block. In the poetry-based type, every
            family has to feed and sustain their poets. In Ethereum or Bitcoin
            everyone who wants to make a transaction has to pay a fee to the
            miners to include the new transaction in the next block.
          </p>
          <h2>Is this how Bitcoin works?</h2>
          <p>
            This is just half of the story. Now you need to understand
            <a href="https://alpa84.github.io/coin/?poetic_blockchain"
              >how digital signatures work and how every part of the system fits
              together to form a currency</a
            >.
