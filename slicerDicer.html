    <h1>Parallel Coordinate Plot as an interface to improve exploration of multi-dimensional datasets</h1>
    <p>Holoviews is a great tool to visualize data. However
        I think the exploration of multidimensional data could be improved</p>
    <h2>Where do we have data?</h2>
    <p>Since a heatmap plot almost saturates the screen possibilities of showing data, visualizing data in more than 3
    dimensions in one plot is very hard, to say the least. A way to deal with this limitation is coming with a way of
    exploring the data. That is being able to choose and see partial views of the dataset.
    Here is the way Holoviews lets you explore a dataset with more axis than a heatmap can show</p>
    <video src="slicer/guessing.mov"></video>
    <p>Two axes are shown in the heatmap and the third axis moved away of the plot
    You are shown only a 'slice' of the data, and you can choose which slice is shown by moving the slider.</p>
    <p>How much data is there in 'z' axis? what are the possible values of the slider can take? In the current Holoviews
    implementation you have to find out by sliding it and seeing where the slider positions itself. There are no visual
    cues.</p>
    <p>another way of representing this data would be a 3d plot, but opaque</p>
    <div id="3dStructured" style="width:600px;height:250px;"></div>
    <h2>What if the data is not in a grid?</h2>
    <div id="3dScattered" style="width:600px;height:250px;"></div>
    <p>To show datapoints that are not regularly spaced a Heatmap can be turned into a scatterplot with colored points. If the
    dataset has one more dimensions than the plot can show, the slider approach does not work so well. The slider lets you
    choose just one value. It that case the scatterplot that would come out of it would typically show only one datapoint,
    because the datapoints are scattered in that axis too. Choosing a single value would mean seeing an infinitely thin
    slice of the data, and if the datapoints are not evenly spaced a slice that is so thin would only include a single
    datapoint.
    Being able to choose a range, instead of a single value would be necessary.</p>
    <h2>A more complete interface for producing heatmaps and scatterplots</h2>

    <h2>Lines can show linear relationships, random, </h2>
    <h2>filtering can make more clear</h2>
    <h2>superimposing plots</h2>
    <h2>filtering can make opaque ok</h2>
    <h2>it is easy to get lost working with multidimentional data.
        A PCP can be a map of where the data is, what are you seeing</h2>
    <h2>Wiggle it</h2>
    <h2>Lines can be overwhelming</h2>

what is the density of data in the axis that is not visible?


can we do more?
