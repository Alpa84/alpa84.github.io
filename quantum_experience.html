        <p>Without a doubt, the coolest bike I have ever ridden was a solid road bike with one of its pedals missing,
          courtesy of the Copenhagen Center for Quantum Devices.</p>
        <p id="continue-reading">In 2018 I started working on a web page that would allow quantum laboratories partnered
          with Microsoft to share experimental results and insights. I got a rare opportunity to glance at hundreds of
          mysterious and very classified plots of quantum experiments. I also watched a dense, two-hour video of
          researchers endlessly tweaking different parameters, and I took notes.</p>
        <p>Some weeks later, I had an idea for a tool that would allow those scientists to visualize the plots in
          context and visually explore a multi-dimensional space of experimental results.</p>
        <p>After some struggle, I had permission to present the prototype in an all-hands meeting at Delft University in
          the Netherlands. Scientists from different labs around the globe were there, along with some top Microsoft
          execs.</p>
          <img src="public/Delft.jpg" alt="inside the Delf University">

        <p>I presented my prototype as if I was a cook navigating through an endless space of ingredient combinations to
          get the perfect cookie formula. The idea caught on. The researchers were excited about it, and building it was
          determined as the top priority for my team.</p>

          <figcaption>I was not allowed to take pics of the meeting but this is the aftermath</figcaption>
        <p>After that amazing moment, and thanks to some good friends, I was invited to visit the Copenhagen Center for
          Quantum Devices and experience firsthand the cutting-edge experiments happening there.</p>

        <p>I sat alongside the researchers, watched them work, and asked questions about how they were visualizing their
          data. It all was invaluable information to build a better tool for them.</p>

        <p>I also pedaled through beautiful Copenhagen streets on the bike they graciously gave me, made good friends,
          and met amazing people.</p>

        <p>We worked on it for a year and had great people collaborating on the project. We had to deal with some
          interesting technical challenges related to the amount of data points we needed to display and trying not to
          stray too far from the strict guidelines for plots on scientific publications. </p>
        <p>The tool was used, but not as much as I had hoped, and in hindsight, my vision for the prototype was never
          fully realized. I learned a lot in the process, including how hard it is to keep a steady course when multiple
          stakeholders have different needs.</p>
        <p>Overall it was a fantastic experience, and it paved the way for collaborating on other cutting-edge projects
          for GenUI and Microsoft.</p>
